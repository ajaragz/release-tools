## release-tools 0.2.0 - (2020-02-25)

**New features:**

 * Automate version updates in pyproject file\
   Besides the file `_version.py`, there is another file that stores the
   version number of the package. This file is `pyproject.toml` and is
   used by `poetry` to generate Python packages and source code tarballs.
   The command `semverup` will also update this version number when
   called. This file will also be part of the release commit generated by
   `publish` command.
 * Update NEWS file with the latest relase notes\
   The command `notes` incorporates the new option `--news`. This flag
   allows to add the contents of the notes generated for the relase to
   the NEWS file. By default, NEWS file will not be updated during the
   release.
